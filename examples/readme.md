# Examples

In this directory are examples on how to use Pinc. These are also used as tests to make sure Pinc works correctly.

Examples source files are all unity builds, for simplicity. They are not just examples, but also tests of the API. In this folder are C source files - each one is named using the format `%i_%s` with their number and real name respectively. This is so they have an inherent order - generally, the first ones are simpler to start.

All of the examples are available as targets in cmake, so they should be relatively simple to build and experiment with.
