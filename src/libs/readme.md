# libs directory within the src directory of Pinc

This is where small header-only bits go. This are headers without implementation files - in other words, the headers ARE the implementations

These are (mostly) self-contained, and under the same license as Pinc. So take this and use them as you like!

Notes:
- pstring.h depends on dynamic_allocator.h
